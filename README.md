This is an open source library that can help to autofocus telescopes.

It implements the algorithm described at Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, Volume 511, Issue 2, April 2022, Pages 2008â€“2020, https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stac189 ( for a preprint, see https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12466 ).



The library contains 4 functions and a class with 8 constructors and 5 functions.

One function (the earlier one) fits half flux diameter data to a hyperbola, from which the correct focus point can be interpolated. This function has no image analysis, which a third party program must provide on its own.

By now, the library also can analyze images. It contains an image class which can be constructed from a path to a fits file, a fits file structure or an array with image data. The image data is then analyzed in fourier space.

A function is provided that takes a vector of image classes constructed from several images and fits it to a parabola.  Robust statistical methods are used in order to remove outliers. From the result of this calculation, an initial guess of the the correct focus point can be determined, which is then used as starting point in non-linear curve fitting methods, also together with robust statistical methods.

The library is currently used in the software Astro Photography tool (APT) for the autofocus routine.

Two test applications are provided.

FM.exe expects a folder with fits files that are defocused at various levels as an argument along with some other parameters. From this the correct focus point is then interpolated with robust statistics and extensive information on the quality of the data is provided.

HFDM.exe has no image analysis. It can compute the focus point from hfd data of defocused images from starfields. If no own hfd data is provided, HFDM will analze HFD data from some historical observations. More and more artificial outliers are added to the data and the user can compare how the different statistical methods behave in the presence of more and more outliers.

The source code is provided in the folder /sources. 
In this folder, a CMakeLists.txt file can also be found.

In order to compile the test applications and the library, one has to change the paths for Open-CV and libfitsio headers and libraries at the places
where it is written in the comments in the CMakeLists.txt file.
Then one has to go into a console window. Change the currend directlory to the directory where the sources are found.
Finally type "cmake ." followed by "make" which should compile the application.

A setup for windows is provided in the /binaries folder. The windows setup installs the binaries of the test applications and the source of the libraries.


The library uses robust statistical procedures and can solve the least trimmed squares problem for small data sets.
For larger datasets, a ransac may be used in the least trimmed squares problem. 
Another option is the use of a modified loss function.


In order to decide if data outside of a given combination should be added to a final configuration of points, various robust statistical outlier detection methods are used. 
If a point is not considered an outlier, it is added to the combination and a fit for the entire set is made. Then, the process starts from another selected combination.

The library makes use of an algorithm for student's distribution, which can be found at Smiley W. Cheng, James C. Fu, Statistics & Probability Letters 1 (1983), 223-227

The library also makes use of Peirce's outlier test. An algorithm for this method was developed in Gould, B. A, Astronomical Journal, vol. 4, iss. 83, p. 81 - 87 (1855).

The library also has the possibility to use MAD, S and Q estimators.

These estimators are extensively described in Peter J. Rousseeuw, Christophe Croux, Alternatives to the Median-Absolute Deviation J. of the Amer. Statistical Assoc. (Theory and Methods), 88 (1993),p. 1273,

Christophe Croux and Peter J.Rousseeuw, Time-effcient algorithms for two highly robust estimators of scale, In: Dodge Y., Whittaker J. (eds) Computational Statistics. Physica, Heidelberg, https :doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-26811-7_58

The library has the option that one can use Siegel's repeated median from Siegel, Andrew (September 1980). "Technical Report No. 172, Series 2 By Department of Statistics Princeton University: Robust Regression Using Repeated Medians" within the RANSAC.

In practice, repeated median regression is a rather slow fitting method. If median regression is not used, the RANSAC will use a faster linear regression algorithm for the hyperbolic fit which was provided by Stephen King at https:aptforum.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?p=25998#p25998).


The algorithm for image analysis in Fourier space was developed by C. Y. Tan. Its output can be fitted to a parabola from which the correct focus can be estimated.

In order to increase the precision of the fit, the fourier data can be analyzed in a two stage process. 

First the trimmed least squares problem is solved for a parabola.

Then this result is used in a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm in order to fit the function

Power=1/(alpha*(x-x0)^2+gamma)+beta+exp(-theta/(alpha*(x-x0)^2+gamma))/(alpha*(x-x0)^2+gamma)

where it is first tested, whether previously excluded points should be re-added as inliers before a final non-linear fit is made.


The least trimmed squares problem is computationally expensive.

The library therefore is also able to do a single curve fit, where it just removes or linearizes the errors that are deemed outliers.
This is different from the least trimmed squares problem, since the fitting parameters are still computed with all points, just the suqared error, 
which is minimized, is not.

Extensive information about the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm and some techniques used by this application in order to improve convergence can be found in
Transtrum, Mark K; Sethna, James P (2012). "Improvements to the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for nonlinear least-squares minimization". arXiv:1201.5885


In the following we describe the test application FM that computes focuspoints from a series of defocused fits files in detail. Then, we describe the functions that the library exports.

FM.exe is a test application for the  curve fitting library that can determine the focus point
of a telescope. The test application expects a folder with fits files at different focuser positions and then interpolates
the focuser position where the telescope is at focus. 

 A CMakeLists.txt file is provided in the sources folder. In order to compile FM and the library, 
one has to change the paths for Open-CV and libfitsio headers and libraries at the places
where it is written in the comments of the CMakeLists.txt.
Then one has to go into a console window. Change the currend directlory to the directory where the sources are found.
Finally type "cmake ." followed by "make" which should compile the application.

In order for this application to work, the fits files need to have the focuser position recorded under either one of the following 
Keywords: FOCUSPOS,FOCUSERPOS,FOCUSERPOSITION,FOCUSPOSITION,FOCUSMOTORPOSITION,FOCUSMOTORPOS

For example a basic usage of this program may be 
FM.exe -d Path_To_my_fits_files -info 3 -e ALL -w 

This would analyze the fits files in the given directory and yield a detailed output. It will make several curve fits for most of the estimators available in the library and write the results into a file.
If one does just want to have a single curve fit with a certain estimator, e.g. the S estimator solving the least trimmed squares problem and a default tolerance, then one may write
FM.exe -d Path_To_my_fits_files -info 3 -e lts_S -w


 If one just wants to print out the focus point for the fit with the S estimator and nothing else (which may be useful if this is fed into another program, write -info 0


FM.exe -d Path_To_my_fits_files -info 0 -e lts_S 
If one wants to have more precision of the curve fit, one can specify the options -lb and -lt. This would start with an initial fit of the function

 Power=1/(alpha*(x-x0)^2+gamma)
and then use these results as initial values in a nonlinear Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm.

If both -lb and -lt are specified, the function
Power=1/(alpha*(x-x0)^2+gamma)+exp(-theta/(alpha*(x-x0)^2+gamma))/(alpha*(x-x0)^2+gamma)+beta

will be fitted. if just -lb is given, then, theta is left to zero. if just -lt is specified, then beta is left to zero.

FM.exe -d Path_To_my_fits_files -info 0 -e lts_S -lt -lb

will make an initial linear trimmed least squares fit. Then, the non-linear fit is started with the inliers from the initial fit.
The function then looks if points that were outliers in the initial fit have to be included when the non-linear fit was made. Then a final
non-linear fit is made with the resulting point set.


The above examples use a default maximum number of outliers in the least trimmed squares problem: 
It is the pointnumber (or the number of images) -7, this means that there are at least
7 points which are assumed not to be outliers. The maximum number of outliers can be specified with the -mo option, e.g

FM.exe -d Path_To_my_fits_files -info 0 -e lts_S -w -mo 3

would find at maximum 3 outliers. If this number could reduce the number of usable points below 7, it is set to 0. 
in general, FM.exe stops with an error if there are not at least 7 images provided.

the trimmed least squares problem is computationally intensive. Its complexity depends on the binomial
coefficient of the pointnumber over the maximum number of outliers.

if one has many points, the program also has the option to make a linear and non-linear regression with all points, but to throw out or linearize errors
whose values are deemed to be outliers. This is different from the trimmed least squares approach, where the entire fit is just made with subsets
of points. Here, the fit is made with all points but the error function, which is minimized, is just computed with a subset of points.

This approach can be selected with err_vanishing and err_linear estimators.

For example  
FM.exe -d Path_To_my_fits_files -info 3 -e err_linear_S  -w

would make a single linear fit with all points, but the error function it tries to minimize would consider the errors of points which
are inliers according to the S estimator as linear contributions, whereas the other errors are squared.

The command

FM.exe -d Path_To_my_fits_files -info 3 -e err_linear_S  -w -lt -lb

would increase the precision with an additional run of a nonlinear fitting algorithm for the function

Power=1/(alpha*(x-x0)^2+gamma)+exp(-theta/(alpha*(x-x0)^2+gamma))/(alpha*(x-x0)^2+gamma)+beta


Currently FM.exe accepts the following parameters

-d Directoryname  or --Directory Directoryname, where Directoryname is the path to a folder with fits files" 

-w  or --Write_to_file if the application should document its output in a file called Directoryname\\results.txt" 

-info number or --Infolevel number, where number ranges from 0 [default] to 3, which sets the level of information that the application prints. 0 means it only prints out the focus point. 3 means it prints the full information"

-m or --Median if the curve fit is done with Siegel's median fitting. The default is false because the median slope is somewhat slow"

-mo number or --Maximum_number_of_outliers number, where number is of type long>=0. It specifies the largest number of outliers that the algorithm can find if it should solve the trimmed least squares problem (the estimators with the lts_ prefix ). The default is the number n of supplied images minus 7. if n<7, then the number of outliers it can find is set to 0. If the binomial coefficient of n and n-8 is larger than 7054320, then the default number of outliers is given by the largest number k where the binomial coefficient of n,k is smaller than 7054320." 

-tol number or --Tolerance number, where number is a value of type float. It sets a cut off value for the estimators. For all estimators the default is 3.0, except for the estumators Significance_in_Grubbs_test, where it is 0.2,Standard_deviation, where it is 2.0" 

-lb indicates whether a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm should be used to fit the beta parameter for the function 1/(alpha*(x-x0)^2+gamma)+beta" 

-lt indicates whether a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm should be used to fit a second order term i.e the function 1/(alpha*(x-x0)^2+gamma)+exp(-theta/(alpha*(x-x0)^2+gamma))/(alpha*(x-x0)^2+gamma) or 1 / (alpha * (x - x0) ^ 2 + gamma) + exp(-theta / (alpha * (x - x0) ^ 2 + gamma)) / (alpha * (x - x0) ^ 2 + gamma)+beta if -lb is additionally specified" 


-e ESTIMATOR or --Estimator ESTIMATOR defines the estimator for the outlier removal procedure. ESTIMATOR can be one of the following variables:" 

NO_REJECTION or 0 This means that no outliers are removed and the tolerance value is ignored. The same behavior can be set by using -mo 0"


ALL_lts This mmeans that the program solves the least trimmed squares problem, where the most optimal point set is searched for. Provided that the maximum number of outliers is >0) several interpolations are made where most of the estimators are triedand the different results noted.For the standard deviation,

For example a basic usage of this program may be FM.exe -d Path_To_my_fits_files -info 3 -e ALL -w This would analyze the fits files in the given directory. It will make several curve fits for most of the estimators available in the library and write the results into a file.




Having described a sample program, we come to the functions that the library exports.


The function focusposition_Regression is only there for compatibility reasons.

By now, it is replaced by the function focusposition_Regression2. The image class contains code for image analysis  in fourier space. From a vector of these
classes, focusposition_Regression2 can interpolate the motor value of the focus point of a telescope.

In contrast to this new method, focusposition_Regression needs hfd values from another image analysis to interpolates 
the optimal focuser position. However, both focusposition_Regression2 and focusposition_Regression have very similar parameters and 
they function in an essentially similar way.

So we begin the introduction of these functions with the old focusposition_Regression.

focusposition_Regression interpolates the focus point from a fit with symmetric hyperbolas. It has the ability to solve the trimmed least squares problem
in order to remove outliers. If specified, it can also use repeaded median regression.
The algorithm for the linear regression was first published by Stephen King (username STEVE333),
at https://aptforum.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?p=25998#p25998

focusposition_Regression expects the following arguments:

a vector <long> x with motor positions at which the hfd number was measured. 
a vector <double> y. The hfd value of a star or a star field corresponding to motor position x [ i ] is assumed to be y [ i ] .
both x and y should have at least 4 points.

If the function terminates successfully, the pointer focpos contains the estimated focusposition as a variable of type long that the function computes. This pointer must not be NULL if the
function is to terminate successfully

main_error is a pointer to a double value. If the pointer is not NULL, the value of main_error will be the sum of the squares of the differences between a square of the the best fit and a square of the measurement data. 
Yes, the errors involve two squares because we calculate the squared error of a fit where the hyperbola was converted to a line.


main_slope and main_intercept are pointers to double values. If the pointers are not NULL, their values will be the slope and intercept of a line given by
Y=slope*(x-focpos)^2+intercept. The square-root f=sqrt(Y) is the fitted hyperbola.

indices_of_used_points is a pointer to a vector which, if not NULL, will contain the indices i of the points in x [i] and y [i] that were used for the fit.

usedpoints_line_x and usedpoints_line_y are pointers to two vectors for the datatype double. If the pointers are not NULL, the vectors contain the points which are used in the fit
in a coordinate system where the hyperbola is a line. One can plot them together with the line  given by Y=slope*(x-focpos)^2+intercept

indices_of_removedpoints is a pointer to a vector which, if not NULL, will contain the indices i of the points in x [i] and y [i] that were not used for the fit

removedpoints_line_x and removedpoints_line_y are pointers to two vectors. If the pointers are not NULL, the vectors contain the points which were not used in the fit
in the coordinate system where the hyperbola is a line. One can plot them together with the line  given by Y=slope*(x-focpos)^2+intercept



stop_after_seconds is a parameter that stops the algorithm after a given time in seconds has elapsed.
stop_after_numberofiterations_without_improvement is a parameter that lets the algorithm stop after it has iterated by stop_after_numberofiterations_without_improvement iterations
without a further improvement of the error. Note that this parameter is not the iteration number, but it is the number of iterations without further improvement.

The parameters stop_after_seconds and stop_after_numberofiterations_without_improvement are only used if the binomial coefficient n choose k is larger than 100*(22 choose 11) == 70543200.


backslash is a parameter that can contain the focuser backslash in steps. The best focus position is corrected with respect to this backslash. If you already have taken account of
the focuser backslash, for example by setting a suitable overshoot or a final_inwards_movement in APT or a different software or hardware correction of the backslash, set this parameter to 0


scale is a parameter of the type double that specifies the size of the interval of motor positions where the best focusposition is searched for. 
The default of scale is 1.
 
Sometimes, the focus point may be outside of the interval of motor positions where the hfd was measured.
let  middle =(max + min) / 2 and max and min be the maximum and minimum motorposition where a hfd was measured.
If an initial search finds the best focus point within 10 positions to be at the right edge of the measurement interval of motor positions,
then, if scale>1, the right side of the interval where the best focus is searched is enlarged. The new right boundary is then given by
max = middle + (max - middle) * abs(scale)
Similarly, if an initial search finds the best focus point within 10 positions to be on the left side of the measurement interval, the search interval is enlarged, with the new left boundary given by
min = (middle - (middle - min) * abs(scale).

use_median_regression is a parameter that specifies whether the RANSAC uses a simple linear regression or a median regression.
Repeated median regression is slightly more stable against small outliers if one does not use the RANSAC algorithm.


rejection_method  is a parameter that specifies the method which is used to reject outliers.
 
The library can solve the least trimmed squares problem. If such an estimator is selected, the application behaves as follows:
 
maximum_number_of_outliers is a parameter that specifies how many outliers the ransac can maximally throw away.

The algorithm works by first selecting combination of points and fitting them to a hyperbola. 

 
Assume you have n datapoints. The algorithm works by searching through either all or (if the binomial coefficient of points over the number of outliers is larger than 20 over 10) randomly generated so - called minimal combinations
of m=n - maximum_number_of_outliers points.
 
An initial fit for a hyperbola is made with these m selected points.  
 
Afterwards, this initial hyperbola is then corrected by contributions from other points. A point outside a combination m is added
if its error from the initial fit is deemed not to be an outlier based on various statistical methods. 
 
A new fit with the added point is then made and the process is repeated with another initial combination of points until the best combination had been found.
The algorithm works in parallel with several threads. So it benefits from processors with multiple cores.
 
 
The error between the fit w of a minimal combination and a measurement at a motor position x is given by err_p=p(x)-w(x) where w is the squared hfd at x. 

If

rejection_method==no_rejection, then the function uses every point for the fit.


rejection_method==Least_trimmed_squares_tolerance_is_maximum_squared_error, 

then a point p outside of the  minimal combination are only added to the final fit if its squared error  err_p*err_p fulfills

err_p*err_p<=abs(tolerance).

The algorithm  then computes an overall fit with this combination, and then constructs a new set based on a different minimal mode, until the best combination of points was found. 

To specify the tolerable error directly is useful if the largest tolerable error is known, e.g. from a measurement of the seeing. By taking a series of images, 
an application may measure the random deviation of the hfd from the average that stars have. With outlier detection methods, one can remove the outliers of large amplitudes.
setting tolerance_in_sigma_units=false, one can supply a maximally tolerable deviation from the average hfd directly to the library as the tolerance parameter.
The tolerance value then corresponds to the absolute value of the maximally tolerable hfd deviation.
note that the error is given with respect to the squared hfd's. I.e if you measure a hfd u at a motor position x, then square its value to g(x)=u(x)^2 and compute the average w(x) of these values. 
The maximum error is then given by the maximum value of M=abs(w(x)-g(x)), where g(x) is such that it maximizes M. The maximum squared error is given by M^2.

If 
 rejection_method=Least_trimmed_squares_tolerance_multiplies_standard_deviation_of_error,

then a point p outside of the best minimal combination is added to the final fit if  error err_p fulfills:

(err_p-a)<= tolerance*s. 

where a and s are the average and standard deviation of the errors err_p for each measured point with respect to the fit of the given minimal combination w that the algorithm tries.

If most of your data is good, then a is rather small and you may want to include most points. 
In that case, set tolerance=1, for example. This excludes only the largest errors that arose from seeing.

However, assume that for some motor positions far away from the focus point, the hfd values do not follow a hyperbola at all and therefore deviate much. 
Or assume that you have a large seeing error and you need to throw many points away.

In that case, your data has many points which have a very large error or difference when compared to a hyperbola. And only a subset of the data close to the focus point may have a small error. 
In order to exclude larger datasets which do not correspond to a hyperbola at all, you would only want to retain errors which are smaller than the average error a. 
In that case, set tolerance=-1 or even -2 if many of your points do have very large errors.


The average and standard deviation is not robust against outliers. If rejection_method== tolerance_is_standard_deviation_of_squared_error_from_mean,
is used, the tolerance value would have to change depending on whether your data contains many outliers or not.

Therefore, the library provides more robust methods for accurate removal of outliers where such changes have to happen less frequently.

If 

 rejection_method==Least_trimmed_squares_tolerance_is_decision_in_MAD_ESTIMATION, or 
 rejection_method==Least_trimmed_squares_tolerance_is_biweight_midvariance, or
 rejection_method==Least_trimmed_squares_tolerance_is_decision_in_S_ESTIMATION, or  
 rejection_method==Least_trimmed_squares_tolerance_is_decision_in_Q_ESTIMATION, or
 rejection_method==Least_trimmed_squares_tolerance_is_decision_in_T_ESTIMATION, 
 rejection_method==Least_trimmed_squares_tolerance_is_percentagebased_midvariance, 

then, MAD, biweight_midvariance, S, Q, T or percentage based midvariance estimators are used. 

A point is then added to a minimal combination if

abs(err_p-median(err_p))/ estimator <= tolerance

where median(err_p) is the median of the errors, and estimator is then the MAD, Q, S or T estimator. 
 
The MAD,S,Q and T estimators are extensively described in
Peter J.Rousseeuw, Christophe Croux, Alternatives to the Median - Absolute Deviation
J. of the Amer. Statistical Assoc. (Theory and Methods), 88 (1993),p. 1273,
Q and S estimators are better suited for asymmetric distributions than the MAD estimator and the Q estimator is better optimized for small sample sizes than the S estimator.

The library also can make use of the biweight midvariance estimator that was described in 
T. C. Beers, K. Flynn and K. Gebhardt,  Astron. J. 100 (1),32 (1990)
if MAD, S, Q, T estimators, biweight midvariance estimators are used, the tolerance parameter should be around 2...3.

if 
 rejection_method==Least_trimmed_squares_tolerance_is_significance_in_Grubbs_test,

then a point p is added to a minimal combination if its error err_p is not an outlier according to a modified Grubb's test.
The tolerance parameter is here a significance value based on student's distribution.
This means, in order to remove an outlier with 90% significance with Grubb's method, one should set tolerance=0.1, for 80% significance, one should select 0.2.

In the original version of Grubb's test, one searches the value err_p where |err_p-a|, with a as average is at its maximum.
One then makes Grubb's test with this value (which depends on the number of samples), and if it is an outlier, one removes this value and repeats the procedure.

This library modifies Grubb's test a bit, in that it does not include points which fail Grubb's test. It does not search for the largest outlier, removes it 
and then recalculates the test statistic with an updated sample size. This is done for computational speed, and it should correspond to the behavior of Grubb's test with a very large sample size
 
If 
 rejection_method==Least_trimmed_squares_use_peirce_criterion, 

then a point is added to a minimal combination if it does fulfill Peirce's criterion for not being an outlier. 

For this the rejection method according to Peirce, the tolerance parameter is not used. 
Note that number of outliers that Peirce's criterion finds is often strongly influenced by the parameter maximum_number_of_outliers

tolerance is a parameter that is used for the different rejection methods.

The trimmed least squares problem is computationally intensive. It increases with the binomial coefficient of the number of points over the maximum number of outliers.
Therefore, if more than 24 points are used, the least trimmed squares prolem is often computationally too expensive.

The library has a different option. It can perform a linear regression with all points and minimize the squared error, but one
can choose to linearize errors from points which are deemed to be outliers. This is done with the estimators 

 errorfunction_linear_tolerance_is_maximum_squared_error,
 errorfunction_linear_tolerance_multiplies_standard_deviation_of_error,
 errorfunction_linear_tolerance_is_significance_in_Grubbs_test,
 errorfunction_linear_tolerance_is_decision_in_MAD_ESTIMATION,
 errorfunction_linear_tolerance_is_decision_in_S_ESTIMATION,
 errorfunction_linear_tolerance_is_decision_in_Q_ESTIMATION,
 errorfunction_linear_tolerance_is_decision_in_T_ESTIMATION,
 errorfunction_linear_use_peirce_criterion,
 errorfunction_linear_tolerance_is_biweight_midvariance,
 errorfunction_linear_tolerance_is_percentagebased_midvariance

The estimators are the same as before in the least trimmed squares approach. 
This computation is nevertheless different from the trimmed least squares regression, since all points are still
used for the computation of the slope and intercept parameters
and just the error function that is used to find the minimum of the hyperbola considers the contributions of
as linear influences. 

Similarly, one can chose to set errors that are deemed to be outliers to zero. This is done by the estimators
 
 errorfunction_linear_tolerance_is_maximum_squared_error,
 errorfunction_linear_tolerance_multiplies_standard_deviation_of_error,
 errorfunction_linear_tolerance_is_significance_in_Grubbs_test,
 errorfunction_linear_tolerance_is_decision_in_MAD_ESTIMATION,
 errorfunction_linear_tolerance_is_decision_in_S_ESTIMATION,
 errorfunction_linear_tolerance_is_decision_in_Q_ESTIMATION,
 errorfunction_linear_tolerance_is_decision_in_T_ESTIMATION,
 errorfunction_linear_use_peirce_criterion,
 errorfunction_linear_tolerance_is_biweight_midvariance,
 errorfunction_linear_tolerance_is_percentagebased_midvariance



The function returns false on error and true if it is successful.

 focusposition_Regression2 computes the focus point from a vector of validly constructed image classes which must all have status 0.
 these image classes can be constructed from a path to a fits file, a fits file structure, or an array with image data. The constructor
 then computes the power spectrum, with which focusposition_Regression2 can work.
 The parameters of focusposition_Regression2 are similar as in focusposition_Regression.
 
 However, focusposition_Regression2 fits a function  
 
 Power=1/ (alpha*(x-focpos)^2+gamma) 
 
 if the pointer to beta and theta is not zero, this fit is used as an initial value in a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm
 that fits the function 
 
 Power=1/ (alpha*(x-focpos)^2+gamma) +exp(-theta/(alpha*(x-focpos)^2+gamma))/(alpha*(x-focpos)^2+gamma)+beta
 
 if the pointer to theta is zero, the function
 
 Power=1/ (alpha*(x-focpos)^2+gamma)+beta
 
 is fitted.
 
 If the pointer to beta is zero, the function
 
 Power=1/ (alpha*(x-focpos)^2+gamma) +exp(-theta/(alpha*(x-focpos)^2+gamma))/(alpha*(x-focpos)^2+gamma)
 
 is fitted.

The function findbackslash_Regression finds the focuser backslash from two measurements of the best focus positions. It returns true if successful.
The idea to correct for the backslash in this way was first published by Jim Hunt (username JST200) at https://aptforum.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?p=26265#p26265

The function expects 2 data sets of motor positions x1 and x2 and hfd values y1 and y2. The function then calls focusposition_Regression and makes a curve fit for both sets.
If the function is successful, the variable value backslash contains the focuser backslash given by the difference 

optimal_focus_point_2 - optimal_focus_point1

the parameters alpha1, beta1,gamma1, indicesofusedpoints1, used_points1_line_x, used_points1_line_y, indicesofremovedpoints1, removedpoints1_line_x, removedpoints1_line_y
and alpha2, beta2, gamma2, indicesofusedpoints2, used_points2_line_x, used_points2_line_y, indicesofremovedpoints2, removedpoints2_line_x, removedpoints2_line_y
have the same meaning as the corresponding return parameters of focusposition_Regression2, just that they are for the two separate datasets x1,y1 and x2,y2.

The parameters stop_after_seconds, stop_after_numberofiterations_without_improvement, maximum_number_of_outliers, tolerance, scale, use_median_regression, use_median_regression
have the same meaning as the corresponding parameters in focusposition_Regression and are used for the fits of both datasets.

The function findbackslash_Regression2 finds the focuser backslash from two interpolations of the best focus positions. In contrast to findbackslash_Regression, it accepts 2 vectors of image classes from 2 consecutive measurements where the
