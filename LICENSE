// The user <cytan>  
// Responsible for:
// The suggestion in https://aptforum.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?p=26471#p26471 to throw out outlier data by comparison of the error with the Standard-deviation.
// (Note that this old idea is now supplemented by more advanced methods, since the average and standard deviation are not robust.)

// The library makes use of an algorithm for student's distribution, which can be found at
// Smiley W. Cheng, James C. Fu, Statistics & Probability Letters 1 (1983), 223-227

// The library also makes use of Peirce's outlier test. An algorithm for this method was developed in
// Gould, B. A, Astronomical Journal, vol. 4, iss. 83, p. 81 - 87 (1855).

// The library also has the possibility to use MAD, S, Q and T estimators. 
// These estimators are extensively described in

// In: Dodge Y., Whittaker J. (eds) Computational Statistics. Physica, Heidelberg, https ://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-26811-7_58

// According to Rousseeuw and Croux, the S estimator has an advantange over the MAD estimator because it can also work for asymmetric distributions.
// The same authors note that the Q estimator is better optimized than the S estimator for small sample sizes.
// 
// The library also can make use of the biweight midvariance estimator that was described in 
// T. C. Beers,K. Flynn and K. Gebhardt,  Astron. J. 100 (1),32 (1990)

// Within the Ransac, the offers the possibility to fit the data using Siegel's repeated median slope from 
// Siegel, Andrew, Technical Report No. 172, Series 2 By Department of Statistics Princeton University: Robust Regression Using Repeated Medians (September 1980)

// In practice, repeated median regression is a rather slow fitting method. 
// If median regression is not used, the RANSAC will use a faster linear regression algorithm for the 
// hyperbolic fit which was provided by Stephen King at https://aptforum.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?p=25998#p25998).
