// Responsible for:
// The suggestion to throw out outlier data in "focusposition_Regression" by comparison of the error with the Standard-deviation.
// Note that this idea is now supplemented by more advanced methods, since the average and standard deviation are not robust.

// The library makes use of an algorithm for student's distribution, which can be found at
// Smiley W. Cheng, James C. Fu, Statistics & Probability Letters 1 (1983), 223-227

// The library also makes use of Peirce's outlier test. An algorithm for this method was developed in
// Gould, B. A, Astronomical Journal, vol. 4, iss. 83, p. 81 - 87 (1855).

// The library also has the possibility to use MAD, S and Q estimators. 
// These estimators are extensively described in Peter J. Rousseeuw, Christophe Croux, Alternatives to the Median-Absolute Deviation
// J. of the Amer. Statistical Assoc. (Theory and Methods), 88 (1993),p. 1273,
